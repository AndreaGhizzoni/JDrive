~ General Structure of the program
================================================================================
> Application Loading
In this phase a launcher program will set up all the cofigurations path necessary
to the GoogleAuthentication and WatcherService.

> Authentication
GoogleAuthenticator provide the required token to do upload/download from client
Google Drive.

> Monitoring (program loop)
If token is aquired, WatcherService start monitoring the base path set.
When WatcherService detects some changes, adds an Object to the upload
queue. More in specific this Object must hold these basic informations:
- type of event ( ENTRY_CREATE, ENTRY_DELETE, ENTRY_MODIFY )
- the path of file/directory
- timestamp
This queue is managed by another Thread that pop from it and upload what the
event object tells her to do.



At this point we have:
- Google Authenticator that holds a authenticated token
    - and tests
- Watcher Service that catch every event from a base path given.
    - and tests
- Configurator ( VERY WIP )
