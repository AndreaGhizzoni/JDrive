~ General Structure of the program
================================================================================
GoogleAuthenticator provide the required token to do upload/download from client
Google Drive.
If token is aquired, WatcherService start monitoring the base path set (*)
When WatcherService detects some changes, adds an Object to the upload
queue. More in specific this Object must hold these basic informations:
- type of event ( ENTRY_CREATE, ENTRY_DELETE, ENTRY_MODIFY )
- the path of file/directory
- timestamp
This queue is managed by another Thread that pop from it and upload what the
event object tells her to do.



At this point we have:
- Google Authenticator that holds a authenticated token
- Watcher Service that catch every event from a base path given.
